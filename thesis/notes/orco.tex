Existing tools

Dask
- resiliency is handled by recomputing tasks
- if data is stored somewhere in the cluster, it is fetched from other workers
- otherwise input tasks are recomputed

Guild.AI (https://guild.ai/)
- mainly for AI

- workflow management tool + DB
- supports dependencies
    - dependencies are specified with decorators (inflexible)
- allows querying job results
- allows modifying schema of stored results
- supports recomputation avoidance

Sacred
- tracks a lot of things

Sumatra
- tagging of experiment runs
- main usage is through cmdline interface
- input configuration files
- integration into Latex
- can run simple parallel computations (MPI)

FGLab
- machine learning dashboard
- unmaintained
