The main goal of the proposed thesis is to improve the ergonomics and efficiency of executing
task graphs on HPC clusters, by analyzing the current bottlenecks and designing and developing
approaches and tools that would improve the experience of users running task workflows on HPC
systems.

In this proposal, various challenges of task graph execution on HPC clusters have been
described, along with hints of possible ways of overcoming these challenges. Current
state-of-the-art task runtimes and their challenges have also been discussed.

The current work done on the thesis so far primarily consists of two areas; analysis of task
scheduling algorithms and analysis and optimization of task runtime
implementation~\cite{estee,rsds}. As future work, I want to apply the experiences gained from my
research so far and design an HPC-focused task runtime that would attempt to mitigate all or
most of the mentioned challenges.
